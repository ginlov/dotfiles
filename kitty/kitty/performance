# The default value yields ~100 FPS which is more than sufficient for

# set sync_to_monitor to no or use a monitor with a high refresh

# Delay (in milliseconds) before input from the program running in

# responsiveness, but also increase CPU usage and might cause flicker
# in full screen programs that redraw the entire screen on each loop,

# Sync screen updates to the refresh rate of the monitor. This
# prevents tearing (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_tearing)
# when scrolling. However, it limits the rendering speed to the
# refresh rate of your monitor. With a very high speed mouse/high
# keyboard repeat rate, you may notice some slight input latency. If
# so, set this to no.
